		<p>In 2016 I loaded my kids into the minivan and took them on a drive across the Northern Midwest states. We went to Wisconsin Dells, the Badlands, Mount Rushmore, Jewel Cave, and Custer State Park.</p>

		<p>
			Here are some memories from the trip:

			<img src="images/jewel_cave.jpg" width="300" alt="Inside Jewel Cave with stalactites and stalagmites.">
		</p>

		<p>I didn't plan for the fact that the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally would overlap with our trip. Many towns were closed to through traffic and the lack of internet required that we use paper maps â€” often.</p>
